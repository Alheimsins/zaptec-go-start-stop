# zaptec-go-start-stop (WIP)

A module for starting and stopping your Zaptec Go EV charger

# Usage

You will need your username and password for the [Zaptec Portal](https://portal.zaptec.com/)

```JavaScript
import { start, stop } from '@alhemisins/zaptec-go-start-stop';

const username = '<your-zaptec-portal-username>';
const password = '<your-zaptec-portal-password>';

start({ username, password }); // starts the charger
stop({ username, password }); // stops the charger

```

# Limitations

If you have multiple Zaptec Go chargers connected to your account this module will only pick the first one.
